**Description:**
The Ritsbot has undergone significant updates to enhance its gameplay efficiency and strategic decision-making. Inspired by Damon's bot, these modifications aim to improve the bot's performance across various scenarios.

**Changes:**
Dynamic Unit Production: The bot now dynamically selects unit production based on opponent unit composition. By analyzing the opponent's units, the bot intelligently adjusts its strategy to counter enemy threats effectively. This adaptive approach enhances the bot's ability to respond to changing battlefield conditions and increases its overall strategic versatility.
Optimized Resource Harvesting: Resource harvesting has been optimized to prioritize closer resources, reducing travel time for workers and maximizing resource collection efficiency. This optimization ensures that workers efficiently gather resources, contributing to the bot's economic growth and overall strength on the battlefield.
Strategic Barracks Construction: Adjustments have been made to the conditions for barracks construction to ensure more strategic resource allocation. By preventing unnecessary building and streamlining the bot's build order execution, these adjustments enhance the bot's strategic planning and resource management capabilities.

**Impact:**
These enhancements collectively contribute to a more adaptable, efficient, and competitive bot. By improving its decision-making processes and strategic capabilities, the AdvancedRush bot is better equipped to challenge a variety of opponent strategies with improved effectiveness. Whether facing aggressive rushes or defensive builds, the bot is capable of applying pressure, securing advantages, and pursuing victory with greater efficiency.
